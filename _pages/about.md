I'm Kanzhong Yao, currently enrolled as PhD student at the [Robotics for Extreme Environments Group](https://uomrobotics.com/), University of Manchester, supervised by Dr. [Simon Watson](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/simon.watson) and Dr. [Ognjen Marjanovic](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/ognjen.marjanovic). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering and a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering, now I'm working on robotics, specifically in multi-robot collaboration in extreme environments. I'm also a [RAICo Junior Fellow](https://uomrobotics.com/collaborations/raico-junior-fellows.html) at [RAICo1](https://race.ukaea.uk/programmes/raico/).

I have experience of working on various robotic platforms. I've conducted a secondment at Hamburg University of Technology, working with [HippoCampus robot](https://hippocampusrobotics.github.io/), under the support of UK [Turing Scheme](https://www.turing-scheme.org.uk/) in 2022. I was also awarded as [2024 NEST Fellow](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_24314/fellows-nest) by University of Tokyo and Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), for conducting development on multiple robot platform for radiation mapping and teleoperation at [Yamashita lab](https://www.robot.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/yamalab), University of Tokyo, working with Pioneer 3-DX ground robots. Apart from that, I've also worked with [BlueROV2](https://robotki.github.io/robots.html#), [MallARD](https://uomrobotics.com/robots/mallard.html),DJI Tello (UAV), [El- MallARD](https://uomrobotics.com/onewebmedia/IEEE%20ICM-2019%20Aquatic%20Surface%20Vehicle.pdf)(land version of MallARD), Jackal, etc.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://uomrobotics.com/). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.png` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
