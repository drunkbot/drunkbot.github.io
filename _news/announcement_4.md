I've started my new role as a researcher in the Embodied AI team at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom, specializing in underwater robotics.

Our team is always on the lookout for passionate research interns from around the world. If you're excited about developing cool robots with us, feel free to drop me an email.
