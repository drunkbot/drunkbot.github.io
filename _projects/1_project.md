<h2>Overview</h2>
In previous [project](https://drunkbot.github.io/projects/3_project/), we noticed that losing of LoS happens from time to time. To address this, we aim to develop a new approach that utilizes mutual camera views from both robots, rather than the traditional leader-follower model.

<h2>Result</h2>
Details of our approach can be found in {% cite Yao2024a %}. The results are very promising, with significant performance improvements observed both in simulation and on physical platforms.
