<h2>Overview</h2>
To extend the findings from [IBVS project](https://drunkbot.github.io/projects/3_project/) and [Virtual Elastic Tether project](https://drunkbot.github.io/projects/1_project/), the analogy between dog walking and cooperative underwater obstacle avoidance was explored. A novel dog walking paradigm was proposed and implemented in conjunction with the VET in the context of fully distributed underwater obstacle avoidance. 

<h2>Collaborators</h2>
Thank Dr Zhengyi Jiang and his cute Bobi for inspiration.

<h2>Note</h2>
Preliminary results has been detailed in {% cite Yao2024 %}. The follow up plan is to implement such paradigm on physical platform.
