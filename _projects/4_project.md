<h2>Overview</h2>
About SARESE x RNE Research Sprint 2022 event: A group of robotics engineers meet together for a 5-day research sprint towards a symbiotic multi-robot fleet for the nuclear sector. My role was to develop Tello Drone software for pre-inspecting simulated radioactive arenas, coordinating with multi-robot fleets, and interacting with a cyber system via ROS.

<h2>Collaborators</h2>
University of Glasgow, Bristol Robotics Laboratory, Sellafield Ltd, RAICo1 Lab

<h2>Outcome</h2>
Created a mixed multi-robot fleet utilising a cyber-physical systems architecture in dynamic inspection, maintenance and repair missions.
